# Lux
This is a simple app that call the default system brightness bar, i'm not an android dev so i've done it at my best considering that i didn't found any valid alternative on the play store.

### The apk file is available in the release section

If you want to build it by yourself ran Buildozer

# Buildozer build:
  - buildozer android clean
  - buildozer android debug
